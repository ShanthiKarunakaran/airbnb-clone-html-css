# airbnb-clone-html-css

## Description of the project:

As a way to learn Tailwind.css, I created this clone of airbnb home page using only Tailwind CSS. It is also responsive. By default Tailwind follows a mobile first approach, so I added on the styles for the larger devices in layers.

## Live version of the cloned page
